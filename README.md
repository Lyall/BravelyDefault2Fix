This is a DLL hook that adds ultrawide/custom resolution support to Bravely Default 2.<br />

## Features
- Support for ultrawide/custom resolutions.
- Centered 16:9 HUD.
- Hor+ FOV and FOV adjustment.

## Installation
- Downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/Lyall/BravelyDefault2Fix/releases) of BravelyDefault2Fix.
- Unzip in to the game directory (e.g **steamapps\common\Bravely Default II**).
- Edit **BravelyDefault2Fix.ini** to enable/adjust features.

## Known Issues
- I recommend only using windowed/borderless. Fullscreen mode in this game is buggy even without this fix. 
- The game is designed around 16:9. You may see glitches/pop-in outside the 16:9 frame, especially in cutscenes.
